# Soroswap Aggregator 

The Soroswap Aggregator Contract currently aggregates different Soroban based AMMs

# Setup and Deployment

**For standalone development read #Development section**

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Be sure to clone the repository with its submodules to ensure proper execution of development, testing, and deploying scripts.

## 1. Setup

1.1 Clone this repo. Submodules are necesary to get the Public and Testnet addresses of the underlying protocols like Soroswap, or to deploy on Standalone those protocols.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules http://github.com/soroswap/aggregator.git
```
> [!TIP]
> If you forgot to clone with the `--recurse-submodules` flag, you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the submodules.

> [!NOTE]
If there was a Testnet reset, and the soroswap/core repo has new Tesnet deployments for test tokens, you want to bring those changes
```
cd protocols/soroswap/
git pull origin main
```

1.2 Copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and modify the necessary parameters
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
For the **secret keys**, you can create an account and private keys in https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test.
For `MAINNET_RPC_URL`, you will need to subscribe to one of the Stellar Mainnet RPC providers: https://app.validationcloud.io/, https://nownodes.io/ or others (ask in the Stellar Discord)

1.2 In one terminal: (choose standalone, futurenet or testnet)

```bash
bash scripts/quickstart.sh standalone # or futurenet or testnet
```

1.3 In another terminal, to enter the docker container

```bash
bash scripts/run.sh
```

1.4 yarn install

```bash
yarn
```

2.- Build the Smart Contracts: after you have the enviroment setted up and inside the docker container you have to build the smart contracts with

```bash 
cd /workspace/contracts
make build
```

### Compile other protocols
If you are considering other protocol that have changed their wasm versions, upgrade them:
For example, for phoenix:
```
cd protocols/phoenix-contracts/
make build
cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm ../../contracts/adapters/phoenix/phoenix_contracts/
```


## 2. Run Tests and Scout Audit
```
cd /workspace/contracts/
make test
```
For Scout Audits (tool created by CoinFabrik), you should enter in each of the sub projects, for example
```bash
cd /workspace/contracts/aggregator
cargo scout-audit
```
or, in the case you want to audit the Soroswap.Finance adapter,
```bash
cd /workspace/contracts/adapters/soroswap
cargo scout-audit
```

## 3.- Check CPU Instructios and Memory Usage
```
cd /workspace/contracts/aggregator
cargo test budget -- --nocapture
```
Export it into a file that you will save together with your changes
```
cargo test budget -- --nocapture > aggregator_budget.txt
```

## 4.- Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts you first would need to build the source with
```bash
cd /workspace
yarn build
```
The .wasm files will already be optimized and will be available in 
`/workspace/contracts/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` with a name like `[NAME-OF-CONTRACT].optimized.wasm`

after the WASMs are built you can run this to deploy, networks can be `testnet`, `standalone`, `futurenet`, `mainnet`. The RPCs will be taken from the `configs.json` file.

```bash
cd /workspace
yarn deploy <network>
```
You can deploy in Futurenet, Testnet and Mainnet from any type of Quickstart Image configuration. However if you want to deploy them on `standalone`, make sure that you have run the quickstart image with the `standalone` config.

when deployment is completed you can find the addresses in ./.soroban directory

If you deployed in Testnet. A new version of Phoenix will be deployed, so you will need to add liquidity to these pairs
```
yarn 
```


Run javascript tests
```
cd /workspace
yarn test
```


## 5.- Publish Phoenix Aggregator in Mainnet
```
yarn build && yarn deploy-phoenix-adapter mainnet

```

## 6.- Publish deployed address.
If you want to publish the json files that are in the ignored `.soroban` folder, do:

```bash
yarn publish_addresses <network>
```

## 7.- Integration Test in Public Testnet. 
Its important to allways test contracts in a live testnet Blockchain.
We have prepared some scripts to interact with the deployed Soroswap.Finance testnet version and with a custom deployed Phoenix protocol. This is because Phoenix does not officially support a testnet version.

You can test the Aggregator methods by running the following command:
```
bash scripts/quickstart.sh standalone
bash scripts/run.sh
yarn test:manual <network>
```
## Development
When deploying to any network other than mainnet the script will also deploy Phoenix Protocol for testing purposes

**For development in standalone you should deploy soroswap smart contracts from the soroswap submodule, to do so there is a script you can run... You will need to set the .env inside the submodule**
```bash
bash scripts/deploySoroswap.sh <network>
```

### Add liquidity to the phoenix pools:
If you want to create and add liquidity to the Phoenix pools, you can do so by running the following command:

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The `TEST_TOKENS_ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` in your `.env` file must be identical to the one used for Soroswap deployment to successfully add liquidity to the pools in Phoenix.

```bash
yarn add-liquidity:phoenix <network> <number of tokens>*
```
This will create pairs with all tokens listed in the [Soroswap tokens list](https://github.com/soroswap/core/blob/main/public/tokens.json).

> [!NOTE] 
> *The number of tokens is optional, if not provided, the script will add liquidity to all the pools.
